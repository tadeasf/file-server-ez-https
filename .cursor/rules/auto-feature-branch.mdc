description: Automatically checkout new feature branch
globs:

Whenever we are building a new feature I want you to use mcp github server to create a new branch and checkout to it. The branch name should be generated by you by analysing the feature we are building. Once feature is build again use github mcp server to create a pull request and notify me about its creation.
